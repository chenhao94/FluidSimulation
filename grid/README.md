# Grid-based Fluid Simulation

In grid-based simulation, we monitor the parameters (velocity and pressure) on the fixed points insteasd of the fluid particles. More specifically, we divide the space in the container into tiny cells in the grid, and record the pressure and velocity on the cell.

We ignore the viscocity, and assume gravity is the only external force, then the first formula become
